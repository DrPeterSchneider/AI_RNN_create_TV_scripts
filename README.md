# AI_RNN_create_TV_scripts

# Project Overview

In this project the goal is to generate a new movie script based on a collection of scripts using a recurrent neural network.
The data is from the TV show Simpsons.

# Packages

For this jupyter notebook to run you need these common packages: Pyhton 3.6, jupyter notebook, numpy, tensorflow.


# Files

helper.py : python file to load and save the models/params

problem_untitest.py : python file to check the outcome of the project

moes_taverns_lines.txt : text data to train on from Simpsons TV series.

dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb: jupyternotebook for the project.

# Conclusion, Findings

The network was predicting text which was a little bit cryptic but one can recognize the learning process of the neural network.
The tuning of the hyperparameters such as RNN Size, Embedding Dimension Size etc. makes all the difference.
